Little scripts for generate strings of DNA
---

Here are a few scripts I use for generating straight, turned and twisted DNA chains based on a geometrical description of DNA.

The methods you will need to call to generate straight our curved DNA segments are found in `dnachain.py`, while the folder `utils` contains a collection of classes for building molecule shapes, bases and sequences.

Some unit testing is handled in by calling `python tests.py`.
