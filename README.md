Python routines for generating simple models of DNA

Modelling DNA geometries computationally can be done very crudely based on
a few DNA motifs and a fractal geometry. It provides a memory efficient way of
ensuring that an appropriate density of DNA is placed in a sample volume.

Shout out to the blender dna example by George Lydecker where
I first saw Blender being used to render DNA, and whose example code
inspired some of what is here. (https://github.com/glydeck/MoloculeParser)
