# How to contribute

## Dependencies

We use `poetry` to manage the [dependencies](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry).
If you dont have `poetry`, you should install with `make poetry-download`.

To install dependencies and prepare [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks you would need to run `install` command:

```bash
make install
make pre-commit-install
```

To activate your `virtualenv` run `poetry shell`.

## Codestyle

After installation you may execute code formatting.

```bash
make codestyle
```

### Checks

Many checks are configured for this project. Command `make check-codestyle` will check black, isort and darglint.
The `make check-safety` command will look at the security of your code.

Comand `make lint` applies all checks.

### Before submitting

Before submitting your code please do the following steps:

1. Add any changes you want
1. Add tests for the new changes
1. Edit documentation if you have changed something significant
1. Run `make codestyle` to format your changes.
1. Run `make lint` to ensure that types, security and docstrings are okay.

### Building and releasing

Building a new version of the application contains the following steps, that are run manually following a merge to master.

- Bump the version of your package `poetry version <version>`. You can pass the new version explicitly, or a rule such as `major`, `minor`, or `patch`. For more details, refer to the [Semantic Versions](https://semver.org/) standard.
- Make a commit to `GitHub`.
- Create a `GitHub release`.
- And... publish ðŸ™‚ `poetry publish --build`
